Frames v2

Backlit picture frames connected wirelessly using Blynk.
An iOS app is used to control the light patterns.
The light patterns are constructed by 3 moving sine waves
of color (red, green, blue). The app controls the speed,
direction, and wavelength of each wave. This results in a
variety of colors when the waves intersect each other.
